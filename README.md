# Pegdrop
#Game Description
# A ball drops from the top of the screen, and as it descends, it must touch each peg and strike the target at the bottom of the screen.

#Game Rules
# When the ball strikes the target, it resets and the game advances one peg to the next level. 

#Players receive a gift after they complete level 10 of the game.

#Game Features
# The game's scoring system is dependent on both attempts and level, therefore completing the level in the fewest number of tries will result in a better score.

# When you exit the game, it retains your level and score in case players want to replay the same match in the future.
